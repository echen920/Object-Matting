Part B.1 Questions (you must answer questions 1-4 to
                    get any credit for Part B.1!!)
------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. What camera model did you use to capture these photos

	A: Canon T3i

 2. What camera settings did you use (if any)?

 3. What was the order in which the photos were captured?
    (eg. "comp1.jpg,comp2.jpg,...")

	A: back1.jpg -> comp1.jpg -> comp2.jpg -> back2.jpg

 4. In 2-3 sentences, describe your image acquistion procedure
    (eg. "I put the camera on a table, then put the object in
     front of a piece of cloth, and took a picture; then ...")

	A: I set up the camera on a table and take a picture of the back1. Then I put the object
	in front of back1 and I capture comp1. After comp1 is taken, object stays still and
	the background is then changed to back2. Finally I take comp2 with back2 and remove
	the object and take a picture of back2. 

 5. If you consider your experiment unsuccessful, explain why
    it was not possible for you to capture a good set of photos for
    the matting algorithm

	A: The result turned out pretty well. I assume the reason to be that of the strong color from the 2 different
	background.

Part B.2 Questions: Note that you need to answer two of the three
                    questions to get full credit for Part B.2. If
                    you answer all three, you will receive EXTRA
                    credit.
------------------------------------------------------------------

First, run the algorithm on the following input:
   Background 1: test_images/small/flowers-backA.jpg
   Background 2: test_images/small/flowers-backB.jpg
   Composite  1: test_images/small/flowers-compA.jpg
   Composite  2: test_images/small/flowers-compB.jpg

Then, run the algorithm with the following input:
   Background 1: test_images/small/flowers-backC.jpg
   Background 2: test_images/small/flowers-backD.jpg
   Composite  1: test_images/small/flowers-compC.jpg
   Composite  2: test_images/small/flowers-compD.jpg

You will notice that in the second run both the computed
Alpha Matte and the Object image has many "artifacts".

------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 1 (10 points)

The Object image computed in the second run contains a lot of pixels
that should really be part of the background, but
aren't. Equivalently, even though the Alpha Matte should be zero
at those pixels, the algorithm assigned non-zero values.

Take, for example, pixel (I,J) = (50,375) with intensity
(243,243,243). Its alpha value is (243/255), i.e., close to 1, even
though it should really be 0. To take a better look at individual
pixels in that region, enter the following values in the view control
boxes on both panels (Zoom: 10; Center I: 50; Center J: 375)

Explain why this pixel has a non-zero alpha. Be as concrete as
possible.

A: In tuition, if you look at the two backgrounds, you will find that they are very similar except for the mirror part.
During the algorithm, the similarity between the backgrounds will actually be considered as part of the object, which is
why the flowers(objects) have an alpha value close to 1. That is to say, if you take a look at the mirror part in alpha,
you will find out that this part has an alpha value close to 1 because it is very different when comparing the composite
and the background. On the other hand, in the point given in the question, the alpha value is very close to 1 because 
the background is almost identical to the composite image, which proves our point earlier. Finally, the result of 
this alpha matte would create some pixels that are meant to be 0 to be 1, and therefore produces many "artifacts"
in new composite image. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Question 2 (10 points)

Conversely, there are many pixels that should be fully opaque
(ie. part of the foreground), but aren't. Take, for example, pixel
(I,J) = (332,164). Even though that pixel is on a flower petal, which
is on the foreground, the intensity of its Alpha component is
(200,200,200), meaning that its alpha value (=200/255) is less than 1.
The effect is that a portion of the flower is taken to be partially
transparent.

Explain why this pixel has non-unit alpha. Be as concrete as
possible.

Hint: examine the linear system of equations that must be solved
      for that pixel (and the associated matrix).

A: In the linear system of equations, notice that the resulted alpha value at a certain pixel will be higher if the 
background and the composite images are more similar and lower if the two are less similar. In the question, the 
alpha value of the pixel is 200/255, which means that at this pixel, the background and the composite share a high
similarity but they are not exactly identical. In this case I would assume that the lighting in the reflection to
the object in the images are slightly different because of the change in background. So the RBG in the pixel between 
the composite and background is slightly different as well. Thus the alpha value returned at this pixel will 
not be a unit factor, creating partial transparency to the alpha matte.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Question 3 (10 points)

Now let's go back to the first run above (ie. the Alpha Matte and
Object computed from the *A.jpg and *B.jpg images).

Looking closely at the computed Alpha Matte, you will notice that the
alpha values are either zero or near zero on the right size of the
vase. For example, pixel (I,J)=(515,819) has intensity (0,0,0). Use
Zoom=1; (I,J) = (515,819) for better viewing...

On the other hand, pixels on the *left* side of the vase have non-zero
(albeit small) alpha values. For example, pixel (I,J)=(50,816) has
alpha equal to 0.1=25/255, suggesting that there is there is an
"object" in front of the background in that part of the photo, with a
transparency of about 90%. The effect may be slight, but it is
noticeable (Use Zoom-1; (I,J)=(50,816) for better viewing).

Why does that pixel (and many others on the left side of the vase)
have non-zero alpha? Be as concrete as possible.


A: If you look closely to background1 and background2 you will notice that on the left side of the image
in background1 there are some wrinkle to the fabric, which is not found in background2. Therefore, the two
backgrounds would have a slightly similar RGB values in the pixels in the shadow region from the wrinkle. 
Thus during the algorithm, it considers that part of the region to be part of the object due to the similarity
in both backgrounds. Although they have little similarity, they are still high in contrast in terms of
their colors. Thus the alpha value calculated will be very low and therefore barely visible in the result.
